# Arrays

As covered in previous labs, we have a range of primitive data types for the fundamental problems we frequently encounter when programming.

As we often deal with lists of values of the same type, these are built into the language directly as arrays.

We specify these with square brackets, and we must specify the size of the array when we create it.

```java
long[] numbers = new long[10]
```
{% next %}

## Show Me the Array

Arrays are naturally complimented by for loops, where we may use the property (more on this later) of the array `.length`.

For example we could declare an array of ten integers, and fill the values with the digits `0-9` (remember arrays start at $'0'$ in Java) with the following code:

```java
int[] numbers = new int[10]

for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    numbers[i] = i
}
```

{% next %}

## Does My Int Look Big In This

Check out the sample code `Largest.java` where we will use for loops and int arrays together

This program will take an integer input, $'n'$, from the user and create an array of integers of length $'n'$. We will then loop $'n'$ times, reading in an integer each time. In a second for loop your program should then calculate which is the largest value of the array, before printing this value to the terminal.

Example Usage:

```
$ java Largest
3       // Input
17
5
10
17      // Output
```

## A Touch of Class

All of the variables we have used so far have been primitive data types. You can do a lot with primitive data types, and in languages such as C we only have primitive data types (and people have done an awful lot with C).

In Java however we have the option of creating more complex datatypes, classes!

Programs can get complex very quickly, in large pieces of software it is simply impossible to keep track of tens of thousands of lines of code when they are in a single file. To make life much easier for ourselves (honestly), we separate our code into functional classes.

## Class Half Full

You may have noticed that you have been using classes in every single Java program you have written in this course so far (nice job!).

We define a class using the `class` keyword, which you may note has been near the start of each of your submissions. Each of our programs have been quite short, so we haven't used many of the features apart from a single function where we have put all of our code.

Each of our classes can contain a number of variables, as well as functions to operate on those variables.

From now on, variables when they belong to a class will be referred to as attributes, and a function which belongs to a class is called a method.

## Method in the Madness

This ability to separate methods into classes is what makes object oriented programming so powerful.

We define a method by first specifying the access modifier of the method, which for now we will make `public`, then the return type of the method, which will be either a primitive data type, another class or `void` to indicate no return type. We then have the name of the method, followed by the types and names of each of the variables the method will take. An example class with a single variable and a single method could be:

```java
public class Student {
    public boolean hasSubmittedAll = false;

    public void submittedAllCoursework() {
        hasSubmittedAll = true;
    }
}
```

The body of this class defines the operations we can perform on this object.

## My Body Is Not An Object

To use classes we must first *instantiate* these as objects. We do this in exactly the same manner as we declared the arrays earlier in this lab e.g.

```java
...
Student alice = new Student();      // Instantiating a class
System.out.println("Alice Submitted Coursework: " + alice.getSubmittedAll())
alice.submittedAllCoursework()
System.out.println("Alice Submitted Coursework: " + alice.getSubmittedAll())
...
```

This is a bit of a boring class currently, so let's add some functionality

## What's in a grade?

Add a `public int` to the class to keep track of the students score, called `grade`, initially equal to `0`.

After each of the assignments, the lecturer will update the students score with a method which will return a `void` called `updateGrade(int mark)`, which will *add* the students grade for that assignment to their `grade`.

The lecturer will want to view the students accumulative grade, so add another method to the class which will return an integer for the current grade called `getGrade()`.

The automarker will be using these terms, so make sure to follow this specification closely!

Here's how could the program could be used in practice:

```java
Student alice = new Student();
Student bob = new Student();

alice.updateGrade(20);
bob.updateGrade(20);

alice.updateGrade(15);
bob.updateGrade(25);

alice.updateGrade(40);
alice.submittedAllCoursework();

if alice.getSubmittedAll() {
    System.out.println("Alice Total Grade: " + alice.getTotalGrade())
}

System.out.println("Bob Submitted All Coursework: " + bob.getHasSubmittedAllCourseWork())

bob.updateGrade(35);
bob.submittedAllCoursework();

System.out.println("Bob Total Grade: " + bob.getTotalGrade())
```
